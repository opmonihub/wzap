# wzap - Agent Instructions

Standalone Go service that manages multiple WhatsApp sessions, exposes an
authenticated REST API, and publishes durable events through NATS JetStream.

## Commands

- `go test ./... -count=1` - run the complete test suite.
- After every frontend interface change, use `agent-browser` against the updated
  local UI to manually exercise affected flows and visually validate rendering,
  relevant states and responsive layouts before declaring completion. Capture
  screenshots and record the tested flows/results as evidence.
- `WZAP_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://wzap:secret@127.0.0.1:5432/wzap_test?sslmode=disable' go test ./... -count=1` - include Postgres integration tests.
- `WZAP_TEST_NATS_URL='nats://127.0.0.1:4222' go test ./internal/events/ -count=1` - include the NATS publisher integration test.
- `go test ./internal/<package> -run TestName -count=1` - run a focused test.
- `go vet ./...`, then `golangci-lint run`, then `go test ./...`, then `go build ./...` - CI order in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint is v2.13.2, only govet/staticcheck/errcheck/ineffassign/unused in `.golangci.yml`).
- `gofmt -l .` must print nothing; `gofmt -w <files>` to fix.
- `docker compose up -d wzap` - start Postgres, NATS, and wzap locally (service at `127.0.0.1:8081`, global API key defaults to `dev-wzap-token`).
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build wzap manager-dev` — Air + Nuxt at `127.0.0.1:8081/manager/`; insert local override between base/dev when present
- `docker compose exec postgres createdb -U wzap wzap_test` - create the test database once (auto-created only on a fresh Postgres volume).

Go 1.26 is pinned in `go.mod`. Postgres integration tests are skipped when
`WZAP_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is absent and FAIL when the database name does not end
in `_test`; each test gets an isolated schema via
`internal/storage/postgres/postgrestest`, so never touch the shared schema in
tests. Do not report integration tests as executed unless the variable was set
and the database was reachable.

## Architecture

Wiring lives in `cmd/wzap/main.go` (`serve` default, `migrate`, `healthcheck`
subcommands). Package boundaries:

- `internal/httpapi/` owns the REST transport, the dual auth boundary
  (manager session JWT in httpOnly cookie OR machine credential in the
  `apikey:` header: global key or per-instance key), RBAC/ownership
  enforcement, and idempotency middleware. Routes live at the root (no
  prefix); `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/swagger/*`, and `/manager/` are public.
  Chi v5.3.2 is the only router, using standard net/http handlers. The root
  composes core/representation and resource packages instances, messages,
  groups, contacts, channels, chats, statuses, profile, users, authsession,
  media and chatwoot; resources own handlers and route registration and do
  not import the root composition package. Messages use
  `/instances/{instance}/messages/{id}` with distinct ancestor/resource IDs.
- `internal/auth/` owns password hashing (bcrypt), instance key minting, and
  session JWTs; `internal/webhook/` owns per-instance webhook config
  validation, delivery (envelope + raw `event`, `apikey:` header), and the
  retry worker with dead-letter logging.
- `manager/` is the Nuxt console (EN, `baseURL /manager/`); `pnpm --dir
  manager build` (`nuxt generate`) renders `.output/public`, embedded into
  the binary via `manager/manager.go` (`go:embed`, SPA fallback). The
  Dockerfile builds it in a Node/pnpm stage (Node only at build time).
- `internal/instance/` owns instance lifecycle; `internal/session/session.go` is the
  engine interface, `internal/session/whatsmeow/` the adapter, `internal/session/sessiontest/`
  the fakes.
- `internal/app/` is the runtime glue: inbound events from sessions become outbox
  events + stored media.
- `internal/message/` owns outbound messages, retries, receipts, and JID
  resolution (incl. the Brazilian 9th-digit rule).
- `internal/events/` owns envelopes, subjects, the JetStream publisher, and the
  outbox relay.
- `internal/media/` owns temporary media storage on `WZAP_DATA_DIR` plus the TTL
  cleaner.
- `internal/storage/repository.go` defines persistence contracts;
  `internal/storage/postgres/` implements them; `internal/storage/migrations/`
  owns the goose-embedded schema (applied by `wzap migrate` or
  `WZAP_AUTO_MIGRATE=true` on boot).
- `internal/config/` loads all `WZAP_*` env vars (empty = unset, missing required
  var fails boot naming the variable); `internal/instancelock/` holds
  process-local locks; `internal/model/` the shared domain types.

Shutdown order is fixed: drain HTTP, then stop outbox, media cleaner, webhook
worker, and the relay last (relay publishes pending events), all within a
shared 10 s deadline; a second signal aborts immediately. At boot the service serves even if NATS is
down (`/readyz` reports it) and the relay ensures the stream when the broker
returns.

## Chatwoot

Optional connector (`internal/chatwoot/`): live WA→Chatwoot mirror (durable
`wzap-chatwoot`), open webhook reusing `Enqueue`, and history import through
direct Chatwoot Postgres SQL (`internal/chatwoot/import`, inert without
`WZAP_CHATWOOT_IMPORT_DB_URL`).

- Envs: `WZAP_CHATWOOT_ENABLED`, `WZAP_CHATWOOT_BOT_CONTACT`,
  `WZAP_CHATWOOT_MESSAGE_READ`, `WZAP_CHATWOOT_MESSAGE_DELETE`,
  `WZAP_CHATWOOT_IMPORT_DB_URL`, `WZAP_CHATWOOT_IMPORT_PLACEHOLDER`.
- Routes: `PUT`/`GET /instances/{id}/chatwoot` (dual auth, token write-only,
  responses mask it), `POST /instances/{id}/chatwoot/import` → `202
  {"imported":N}` with N counting messages only (dual auth),
  `POST /chatwoot/webhook/{id}` open by design.
- Mirror: text/media (incl. stickers), contacts (single+array), locations,
  lists, reactions, interactive/buttons (incl. PIX), orders, products, ads
  (thumbnail attached when bytes present); polls/calls/protocol notices
  warn+skip.
- Import: phone+time order, `WAID:` source_id dedup shared with the mirror,
  `days_limit` window, chunk failures return the partial count with the
  error, display_id retries `UNIQUE(account_id,display_id)` conflicts
  (bounded, Rails allocates outside the mutex), triggers auto post-pairing
  once (fire-and-forget) + manual + 30min cron (6h window, clears accumulators
  and the connector cache), pt-BR operational notices. Shutdown stops the
  import scheduler before the relay; the import `Pool.Close` has its single
  owner in `serve()`.
- Operational risks: token stored in plaintext but never echoed (write-only),
  open webhook (SSRF-gated attachment fetch: http/https only, ≤3 redirects,
  metadata/link-local always blocked, private hosts only for the configured
  Chatwoot url), direct SQL against the Chatwoot database (isolated module,
  URI-guarded).

## Conventions And Gotchas

- Keep internal imports rooted at module `wzap`.
- Preserve the REST envelopes (`{"data": ...}` / `{"error": {"code", "message"}}`
  + `X-Request-Id`) and the versioned event contract (`event_version: 1`,
  stable `event_id` sent as `Nats-Msg-Id`) documented in `README.md` and
  `openspec/specs/`. Mark breaking contract changes with **BREAKING**.
- REST collections use direct named arrays under data: instances, users,
  groups, messages, channels, statuses, contacts and blocked_jids. Channel
  updates return messages. next_cursor is a sibling of the collection and
  omitted when there is no next page. Individual endpoints keep envelopes.
- Required arrays are non-nil, have no omitempty, and serialize empty as [];
  preserve required false, 0 and "0". Optional absent fields/objects are
  omitted; use pointers for meaningful absence and optional timestamps.
  integration.webhook remains mandatory when disabled, including events.
  settings and chatwoot_config are omitted when unavailable. Internal fields
  and secrets remain excluded; GET /instances has no server pagination.
  JSON property order is not a contract requirement.
- Delivery is at-least-once; event IDs must remain stable across retries and
  consumers dedupe by `event_id`.
- The supported runtime is one replica; locks are process-local.
- The service is independent of its consumers. It manages its own operator
  accounts (admin/user with instance ownership, quotas, and keys); tenant,
  account, and business-domain concepts stay outside this repository;
  consumers correlate an instance through the opaque `external_ref`.
- Never commit secrets or local environment files (`.env` overrides the compose
  dev API key).
- Use conventional commits with concise scopes such as `feat(api):`,
  `fix(events):`, and `docs(specs):`.

## Spec-Driven Workflow (OpenSpec + Superpowers)

- Workflow follows the `superpowers-bridge` conventions (brainstorm → proposal
  → specs → design → tasks → plan → verify → retrospective), encoded in this
  file plus `openspec/config.yaml` — no installed schema directory (deliberate:
  the CLI tracks built-in `spec-driven`; the rest is agent-enforced).
- OpenSpec owns WHAT and WHY in `openspec/changes/<name>/` (`brainstorm.md`,
  `proposal.md`, `specs/`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `plan.md`, plus `verify.md`
  and `retrospective.md` post-apply); capability specs live in
  `openspec/specs/`. Rules live in `openspec/config.yaml`.
- Superpowers owns implementation quality: brainstorming only for fuzzy
  requirements, TDD for behavior changes, systematic debugging for failures,
  code review before commits, verification before completion.
- Settled requirements go directly through `openspec-propose`; implementation
  uses `openspec-apply-change` (worktree + subagents, apply requires `plan.md`);
  finished changes get `verify.md` + `retrospective.md` BEFORE the PR and are
  archived last with `openspec-archive-change`.
- Manual agent worktrees (OpenSpec-apply / Superpowers) live in `.worktrees/`
  at the repo root (git-ignored, one directory per change, e.g.
  `git worktree add .worktrees/<name> -b <branch>`); remove the worktree
  after the branch merges. Never nest worktrees elsewhere.
  `.kilo/worktrees/` is owned exclusively by the Kilo Agent Manager extension
  (created/closed via the panel, tracked in `.kilo/agent-manager.json`) —
  never create manual worktrees inside it and never point manual tooling at it.
- Never write brainstorm/plan output to `docs/superpowers/`; it belongs in the
  change directory.
- Treat `tasks.md` as the scope contract. Mark an item complete only after its
  specified verification succeeds.

## Local Agents (Codex + Factory)

Skills and droids are installed on the machine and are not committed. Codex and
Factory share one skill directory:

- `.factory/skills/` holds the OpenSpec skills and any other local skills.
- `.codex/skills` is a symlink to `../.factory/skills`.
- `.factory/droids/` holds `explorer` (read-only), `log-detective` (running
  stack, read-only), `implementer` (writes inside a briefed scope), and
  `griller` (design interview).
- OpenCode, Cursor project config, and `.agents/` are not part of this repo.

Orchestration:

- Delegate independent work, mainly reading: exploration, diagnosis, and
  review. Sequential work that needs judgment between steps stays on the main
  thread.
- Isolate each agent by write scope. The brief names the paths it may edit,
  and it leaves the rest alone. Reading is unrestricted.
- Never run two agents writing the same files at the same time.
- A feature that crosses the Go service and `manager/` does not start as two
  parallel agents. Fix the contract first (route, payload, status, event
  shape) in the spec or design, then give each side an `implementer` with its
  own scope.
- Every brief includes the goal, context already gathered, write scope, what
  not to touch, how to verify, and the return format.
- The return is a summary with `file:line` evidence, separating fact from
  inference and listing what was checked and what was left out.
- The main thread decides and talks to the user. A subagent report is the
  source; do not redo the search it already did.
